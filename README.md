# juliapp
.NET Runtime for Julia++
VERY EXPERIMENTAL, MOSTLY NOT FUNCTIONAL AT THE MOMENT!
Designed to implement julia into .NET. Will translate julia into JIL (Julia Intermediate) which will then lower to IL or Machine Code on type specialization

The current goal is provide full julia functionality. In the future this will extend the julia language.
